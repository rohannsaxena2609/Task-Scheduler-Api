# Task-Scheduler-Api
This project implements a lightweight, command-line-based Task Scheduler using C++. It allows users to schedule tasks to run at specific times, list all scheduled tasks, and delete tasks when needed. The system leverages multithreading for task execution, ensuring scheduled tasks run concurrently without blocking the main application.
